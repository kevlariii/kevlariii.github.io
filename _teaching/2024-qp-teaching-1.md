*From March 2024 to June 2024* <br>
Being a TA for this **first-year engineering course** wasn’t just about physics—it was about making abstract concepts click. My role included:  

- 🔍 Crafting **exercises and quizzes** that pushed students beyond textbook formulas.  
- 🎙️ Running **weekly 1h30 sessions**, where I broke down tough topics, answered tricky questions, and sometimes even made quantum physics *fun* (or at least less intimidating!).  
- 🚀 Helping students **prepare for exams**, making sure they didn’t just memorize equations but actually understood the “why” behind them.
