*From November 2024 to June 2024*<br>
For an entire academic year, I tutored high school students of various levels in **mathematics**. This wasn’t just about solving equations—it was about building the **strong mathematical foundation** necessary for AI.  

This tutoring program was part of **SaclAI School**, an initiative dedicated to making **AI knowledge accessible to everyone**, from beginners to experts. My role included:  

- 🔢 Strengthening students' **understanding of core math concepts**, ensuring they had the tools to dive into AI later on.  
- 🎓 Adapting explanations to different learning styles, making math more **engaging and intuitive**.  
- 🤝 Encouraging curiosity and problem-solving skills, helping students see math not just as a subject, but as a powerful tool.
