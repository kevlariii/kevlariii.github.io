👨‍💻 I'm a gap year student at *CentraleSupélec, Paris-Saclay University*, specializing in **AI engineering**.  

## 🔬 Research Interests  
I'm passionate about language models for safety and inclusion. My work revolves around making GenAI systems more responsible, fair, and robust. This includes fine-tuning models on use cases such as Safe Image & Video Generation, Code Vulnerability Detection etc. But also collecting and publishing curated datasets for low-resource and under-represented languages.

## 💼 Experience  
- 🎯 **Current Internship:** Cloud Services Intern at [**fifty-five**](https://www.fifty-five.com/), a Paris-based data consulting company. Currently working on Cloud Optimization to reduce cost and CO2 emissions of Cloud projects. 
- 💎 **Past Internship:** Data Scientist at [**Richemont**](https://www.richemont.com/), where I developed GenAI-based systems for analytics automation.  

## 🚀 Community & Open Source  
I'm a co-founding member of [**lemon42-ai**](https://github.com/lemon42-ai), where we build projects at the intersection of AI safety, impact & inclusion.  

### 🔗 Open Source Contributions  
- Contributing to the 🤗 [**Hugging Face Hub**](https://huggingface.co/lemon42-ai) with fine-tuned models & curated datasets.  
- Sharing analytics & insights on emerging models and techniques to help AI practitioners make informed choices. *(Check my [Portfolio](#) & [Blog](#) sections!)*  

## 📝 Research Contributions  
📄 **[Pre-print, submission]** – Co-authored [**DiffGuard**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00064), a smaller, stronger, and faster safety filter for diffusion models. <br>
🔍 **Key Features:**  
- Most powerful open-source text-based safety filter (as of submission).  
- Trained on a newly curated dataset to block sensitive topics (nudity, gore, violence, etc.).  
- Highly robust against adversarial attacks (prompt dilution, jailbreaking).  
- Easily integrable with any text-to-image or text-to-video model.  

## 🎓 Education  
I'm pursuing an engineering degree at *CentraleSupélec*, one of the top 3 engineering schools in France.
