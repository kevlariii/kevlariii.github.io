<!-- # 👋 Hey there! I'm Mohammed. -->

👨‍💻 I'm a **gap year student** at *CentraleSupélec, Paris-Saclay University*, specializing in **AI engineering**.  

## 🔬 Research Interests  
I'm passionate about **language models for safety and inclusion**. My work revolves around making AI systems **more responsible, fair, and robust**.  

## 💼 Experience  
- 🎯 **Current Internship:** Data Science Intern at **fifty-five**, a Paris-based data consulting company.  
- 💎 **Past Internship:** Data Scientist at **Richemont**, where I developed **GenAI-based systems** for analytics automation.  

## 🚀 Community & Open Source  
I'm a **co-founding member** of **lemon42-ai**, where we build projects at the intersection of **AI safety, impact & inclusion**.  

### 🔗 Open Source Contributions  
- Contributing to the **Hugging Face Hub** with **fine-tuned models** & **curated datasets**.  
- Sharing **analytics & insights** on emerging models and techniques to help AI practitioners make **informed choices**. *(Check my [Portfolio](#) & [Blog](#) sections!)*  

## 📝 Research Contributions  
📄 **[Pre-print, submission]** – Co-authored **DiffGuard**, a **smaller, stronger, and faster safety filter** for **diffusion models**.  
🔍 **Key Features:**  
- **Most powerful open-source text-based safety filter** (as of submission).  
- **Trained on a newly curated dataset** to block **sensitive topics** (nudity, gore, violence, etc.).  
- **Highly robust** against **adversarial attacks** (prompt dilution, jailbreaking).  
- **Easily integrable** with any **text-to-image** or **text-to-video model**.  

## 🎓 Education  
I'm pursuing an **engineering degree** at **CentraleSupélec**, one of the **top 3 engineering schools in France**.
